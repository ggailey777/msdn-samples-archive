# MSDN Samples Archive for ggailey777

This is the archive of samples that I personally created and published to MSDN Code Gallery over the years to support the following Microsoft technologies: 

+ WCF Data Services
+ OData
+ Azure Mobile Services
+ Windows Phone
+ Notification Hubs
+ Windows apps

Most of these projects are very out of date and most of the technologies are no longer supported. Many were created to support posts on my old [Writing Data Services](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/writingdata_services/) blog, so I just wanted to keep these around for posterity's sake. (Thanks [GitHub](https://github.com/ggailey777).)
